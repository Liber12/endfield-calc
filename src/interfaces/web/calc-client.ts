/**
 * Client for the calculation worker (`src/interfaces/web/calc.worker.ts`).
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   1. **Transport** — module-worker preferred; graceful main-thread
 *     fallback (dynamic import of `@/lib/calculator` + HiGHS) when
 *     Workers are unavailable (vitest/node), construction fails, or
 *     the failure budget is exhausted (globally or per job). A worker
 *     crash mid-solve is invisible to callers: the inflight job is
 *     re-dispatched onto a fresh worker, then onto the fallback.
 *     Mirrors the ELK dual-path precedent (`src/lib/layout.ts`).
 *   2. **Latest-wins coalescing** — at most one job in flight; a newer
 *     solve replaces the parked solve slot, rejecting the replaced
 *     promise with `CalcSupersededError`. This is what keeps
 *     scrub-drag commit streams from stacking solver work: however
 *     fast edits arrive, exactly one solve runs and only the newest
 *     waits.
 *   3. **Optimizer searches** — `searchMaximize` / `searchFit` run the
 *     whole Max/Fit bisection IN the worker as a single job (probes
 *     never round-trip plan graphs, and they can't displace a parked
 *     display solve). Searches have their own single parked slot,
 *     dispatched ahead of a parked solve — the solve then re-runs
 *     against whatever the search left behind, which is the fresher
 *     answer. Each search returns a `cancel()` handle: parked → the
 *     promise resolves `{ kind: "cancelled" }` immediately; inflight →
 *     a `cancel-search` control message flips the engines' per-probe
 *     `isCancelled` poll (fallback path polls the same flag directly).
 *
 * Callers treat `CalcSupersededError` as "ignore silently" — a newer
 * request is already carrying the fresh answer (see the catch branch
 * in `useProductionPlan`'s calc effect).
