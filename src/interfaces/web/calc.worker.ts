/**
 * Calculation worker — hosts the HiGHS WASM solver, the full
 * `calculateProductionPlan` pipeline, AND the optimizer search loops
 * (Max / Fit bisection) off the main thread.
 *
 * WHY: `@bubblyworld/highs-ts` is async-API'd but its WASM executes
 * synchronously on the calling thread. On the main thread every solve
 * (multi-pass lexicographic LP + the Phase 3 ILP packer) froze pointer
 * processing — visible as scrub-drag jank. Same rationale as the ELK
 * layout worker (`src/lib/layout.ts`).
 *
 * WHY searches run here too: a Max/Fit search is 40-60 probe solves.
 * Driving them from the main thread round-tripped a full structured-
 * clone of the plan graph per probe (the search only needs the
 * verdict) and made probes displace display calcs in the client's
 * latest-wins queue. In-worker, a search is ONE job: probes call
 * `calculateProductionPlan` directly and only the small result
 * crosses the boundary.
 *
 * Protocol (see `src/interfaces/web/calc-client.ts` for the client side):
 *   worker → main : { kind: "ready" }                    once, after WASM init
 *   main → worker : { kind: "solve", seq, targets, items,
 *                     recipes, facilities, options }
 *   worker → main : { kind: "result", seq, plan }
 *   main → worker : { kind: "search", seq, op, targets, … }
 *   main → worker : { kind: "cancel-search", seq }       control message
 *   worker → main : { kind: "search-result", seq, result }
 *                 | { kind: "error",  seq, message }
 *
 * The client guarantees at most ONE outstanding solve/search job
 * (latest-wins coalescing happens client-side); `cancel-search` is a
 * fire-and-forget control message that may arrive while that job runs
 * — the engines poll `isCancelled` before every probe solve, so the
 * event loop picks the flag up between probes. All payloads are
 * structured-clone-safe (Maps/Sets/plain data).
 *
 * Business logic stays in `@/lib/calculator` / `@/lib/target-optimizer`
 * — this file is transport only. Keep it that way.
