## Overview

**Endfield Calc** is a production chain calculator for **Arknights: Endfield** that helps players plan resource requirements, production ratios, and facility needs—including circular production loops.

## Key Features

### 🎯 Core Functionality
- **Multi-target planning** with automatic dependency resolution
- **Smart recipe selection** with circular dependency handling
- **Real-time calculation** of facility counts and power consumption
- **Manual raw material marking** for flexible supply chain control

### 📊 Dual View Modes

#### Table View
- Comprehensive production breakdown with all metrics
- **Interactive hover**: Highlight upstream dependencies on mouse hover

#### Dependency Tree View
Two visualization modes for different planning needs:

**Recipe View**: Aggregates facilities by recipe type, shows total requirements
- Best for overall recipe optimization and material flow overview

**Facility View**: Shows each individual facility as a separate node
- Best for detailed capacity planning and load balancing
- Displays capacity utilization and precise material allocation

Both modes feature interactive flow diagrams, cycle visualization, and flow rate labels.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Visualization**: React Flow with Dagre layout
- **UI**: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
- **i18n**: react-i18next

## Getting Started

### Try Online
Visit **[https://JamboChen.github.io/endfield-calc](https://JamboChen.github.io/endfield-calc)**

### Local Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JamboChen/endfield-calc.git
cd endfield-calc
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### CLI calculation

The production solver can also run without React through the Bun-based CLI. It uses the same game data, AIC/region filtering, facility and raw limits, region structures, Metastorage rules, recipe pins, manual raws, self-sustaining power, gas-environment coverage, and HiGHS-backed production solver as the web app.

```bash
# One target, using the web app defaults for Valley IV
pnpm calc -- plan --target item_iron_powder:60 --pretty

# Reproduce a fuller site configuration from JSON
pnpm calc -- plan --config examples/cli-plan.json --pretty

# Priority-Max for one target (locked target suffix: 30l)
pnpm calc -- max --config examples/cli-plan.json --item item_iron_powder --pretty

# Scale unlocked targets to configured limits
pnpm calc -- fit --config examples/cli-plan.json --pretty
```

The CLI writes machine-readable JSON to stdout. Its config deliberately mirrors the site's state split:

- `settings.domains/aic/rawLimits/structures/metastorage` correspond to persisted domain settings.
- `plan.recipeOverrides/manualRawMaterials/powerSustain/machinesPerVaporizer` correspond to plan-specific calculation options.
- `targets[].locked` is used by `max` and `fit`; it does not change an ordinary `plan` solve.

Use `pnpm calc -- --help` for the complete command-line syntax. Bun is required, matching the existing `extract:*` scripts.

### Docker

**Step 1: Build the image via GitHub Actions**

The image is hosted on GitHub Container Registry and must be built first. Go to your repository on GitHub:

> **Actions** → **Docker Build and Push** → **Run workflow**

This pushes the image to `ghcr.io/your_username/endfield-calc:latest`.

**Step 2: Run with Docker Compose**

Edit `compose.yaml` and replace the placeholder values:

```yaml
services:
  endfield-calc:
    image: ghcr.io/your_username/endfield-calc:latest
    ports:
      - "your_port:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Build locally**

If you prefer to build the image on your own machine instead of using GitHub Actions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JamboChen/endfield-calc.git
cd endfield-calc
docker compose -f - up -d <<EOF
services:
  endfield-calc:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "your_port:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
EOF
```

Or edit `compose.yaml` to replace `image:` with `build: .` and run `docker compose up -d --build`.
